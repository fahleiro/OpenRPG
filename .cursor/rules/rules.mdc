# rules
- always document code blocks in the server source code in order to have documented parts of the code for a clear and concise understanding of what that logic does;
- always document in /docs so GitBook is updated, always including examples of features and detailed descriptions of features (API endpoint logic), with examples of how to apply them;
- never create real-life server examples, since this is only the core without actual server functionality â€” documentation will only exist in GitBook; 
- never document isolated features provided by the core server in `docs/README.md`; this path is only for documenting generic topics about the server;
